Create artwork for your palette using HyperCard's built-in paint tools 
or paste
in bit-map art from elsewhere using the clipboard or scrapbook. Here you
 draw the 5 boxes as shown and name each one. Once you have finished the
 boxes create 5 buttons to fit inside them. All buttons end up as 
transparent in a palette. Here are the scripts for the buttons. The 
second line of each button's script is used as the message the palette 
will pass when the button is depressed in the palette. Copy and paste 
the scripts from the list below</p><p>

In a palette you are limited to one line scripts, however, if you should
 need more than a line of script to be executed when a button is 
depressed; create a handler, put it in the stack or background script 
and then simply put the handler's name in the second line of the 
button's script. </p><p>

3. Choose Window Style:</p><p>
Allows you to decide whether the palette will have its name displayed in the
drag region or not. Just click on your choice and it will hilite.</p><p>

4. Choose Hilite type:</p><p>
Inverse hilite: allows you to specify whether buttons in the palette will be
inverted (blackened) when depressed. Framed hilite: allows you to specify
whether buttons in the palette will be framed when depressed.    </p><p>

Remain hilited: When not enabled buttons in the palette will be hilited
momentarily (like autoHilite), and when enabled they will retain their
highlight (like radio buttons).</p><p>

5. Create Palette:</p><p>
Create Palette: takes your artwork and buttons and turns them into a palette.</p><p>

<img src="Palette%20Maker_files/palette1.gif"></p><p>
Now you can test your new palette by clicking on each of the buttons</p><p>

6. Install Palette...:    </p><p>
Install Palette: asks you which stack you would like a copy of this palette
installed in.</p><p>

7. Misc. Palette Instructions:</p><p>
New Palette Card: creates a new palette card.</p><p>

Delete Palette: deletes the current palette from this stack or another if you
wish.</p><p>

Show Palette: displays  the palette you specify  from this or another stack in
the center of the card or where you would like.</p><p>

<img src="Palette%20Maker_files/palette4.gif"></p><p>

Show Commands: displays a list of all the commands from the palette you specify
in this or another stack.  You can also highlight the button which corresponds
to a particular command. If the palette is from the current card you will be
given the option to edit the scripts associated with.</p><p>

More about the Palette Maker:</p><p>
The Palette Maker consists of two XCMDs, the "Palette" XCMD which is attached
to HyperCard itself and the "NewPalette" XCMD which is attached to this stack.
The NewPalette XCMD creates a "PLTE" and a "PICT" resource for each palette. </p><p>

<img src="Palette%20Maker_files/palette7.htm"></p><p>

The PICT is the artwork for the palette and the PLTE is a code description of
the palette including the palette's commands. The Palette XCMD is responsible
for finding and uniting the "PICT" and "PLTE" resources to display the
palette.</p><p>

Warnings: The Palette XCMD will not display two palettes with the same name at
the same time. Several palettes can be open at the same time as long as they
have different names.</p><p>

For best results, do not create palettes with the same name using 
Palette Maker. The NewPalette XCMD will delete resources with the same
names as the ones it is creating.</p><p>

If you want a colour palette simply replace the black and white PICT
resource with a colour one.</p>
