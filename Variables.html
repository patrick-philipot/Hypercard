<h2>Variables</h2>


Like fields and buttons, variables are containers. However, unlike 
fields and buttons, the size of a variable is not limited to 30,000 
characters, but depends only on how much available memory (RAM) you 
have. You can create a variable whenever you need one and you can create
 as many as you wish.<p>
</p><p>
<b>Variables are containers where values can be stored.</b></p><p>
</p><p>
Usually variables are local variables which are only valid in a single 
operation. Global variables are used for longer storage ( ie until the 
stack is closed ). For permanent storage Fields are normally used</p><p>
</p><p>
When variables are created using the message box they are <b>global variables</b>
Here are some examples of global variables to try using your message box</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
type <b>put "cat" into dog</b> and press return</p><p>
then type <b>dog</b> and press return</p><p>
</p><p>
<img src="Variables_files/variable2.gif"></p><p>
</p><p>
type <b>put "poodle" into dog</b> and press return</p><p>
then type <b>dog</b> and press return</p><p>
</p><p>
In each example dog is a global variable in which you can store values. You can
retrieve the value by invoking the name of the variable in this case dog.</p><p>

</p><p>
type <b>put 10.3 into dog</b> and press return</p><p>
then type <b>dog</b> and press return</p><p>
</p><p>
Often we choose letters to stand as variables much like mathematicians choose
them in algebra. Try these examples using x and y as variables</p><p>Select Copy and paste these examples, one line at a time, into the Measage Box, then press return</p><p>
