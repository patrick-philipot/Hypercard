The Message Box is a way of sending out commands to make things happen as well
as a container to which all kinds of results can be sent.</p><p></p><p>

Many of the properties of HyperCard can be viewed and changed through the Message Box</p><p>

Any script that works in the Message Box will also work as a script in a button
a field a card , background or stack. This makes the Message Box ideal for
testing ideas or working out why scripts work or dont work</p><p>

Above we have used <b>put</b> and <b>set</b>.
These two words are commands in hyperTalk and they are applied to change or
evaluate properties of objects like buttons and fields. <b>Get</b> is a related
command, and puts the value of expressions into a variable called <b>It</b>. </p><p>
