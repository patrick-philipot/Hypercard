<h2>Random Numbers Stack</h2>

Random is a very useful HyperCard function. One common use is to be able
 to set up maths problems that present different numbers each time the 
problem is encountered<p>
Make a new stack. </p><p>
</p><p>

The stack can be small as above. Create a button and name it <b>Random</b>.
 Create a small rectangular field. You could set the text file in the 
field to a larger font size, say 16, and maybe a different font. Clone 
this field 5 times so you have 6 fields side by side. Fields are cloned 
by clicking on them with the field tool selected and holding the mouse 
down while you hold the <b>Option</b> key down and drag the new field to it's new position. </p><p><img src="Random%20Numbers%20Stack_files/clone.gif"></p><p>
<br>Cloning a field is the same as copying and pasting but faster! It 
also ensures that the fields are all the same size and have the same 
settings. Notice the fields are numbered in the order of creation</p><p>

Paste the following script into your "Random" button:</p><p><br>
</p><form>
<textarea rows="21" cols="100" wrap="off">on mouseUp
  repeat with i = 1 to 6
    put empty into cd fld i
  end repeat
  put empty into randNum
  put 6 into uniqueNum
  put 49 into selNum
  put empty into theNum
  repeat with i = 1 to selNum
    put i into item i of theNum -- sets up list of items 1 to 49
  end repeat
  repeat with i = 1 to uniqueNum
    put random(the number of items in theNum)into thisOne -- selects an item from list
    put item thisOne of theNum &amp; "," after randNum
    delete item thisOne of theNum -- removes the selected item from list
  end repeat
  repeat with i = 1 to 6
    put item i of randNum into cd fld i
  end repeat
end mouseUp
</textarea>
</form><p>

This script will generate 6 unique random numbers each time you click the "Random" button.</p><p>
You could make more fields for more random numbers and change the 
"sixes" in the script to the new number. Or you could change the 49 so 
that number you choose to select the random numbers from is greater ot 
smaller. Experiment with the script so you understand how it works. The <b>Commas</b> are used to separate (or delimit) the <b>items</b>. <b>randNum, uniqueNum, selNum, theNum and thisOne</b> are variables.</p><p>

To clear the random numbers when you close the card put the following script in your card script</p><p>
</p><form>
<textarea rows="6" cols="40" wrap="off">on closeCard
  repeat with i = 1 to 6
    put empty into card fld i
  end repeat
end closeCard
</textarea>
</form><p>
