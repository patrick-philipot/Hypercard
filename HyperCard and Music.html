The play command can take a digitised sound and play notes. The notes can
vary in pitch, length and tempo so that quite passable tunes can be constructed
using a digitised sound. The beauty of this is that long tunes take up only a
tiny space. On my "101 Australian Folk Songs" stack all the words and all the
music can still fit on one floppy disk! The drawback is that the tunes sound a
bit mechanical. Here's a sample tune called Brisbane Ladies</p><p>

Copy the script and paste into a button on your stack. Of course you need a
sound resource called Fiddle or else you can try it by replacing Fiddle in the
script with Harpsichord which is build in to hyperCard.</p><p>
</p><p>
Instead of numbers you can use the names of the note so that 60 is middle C and
61 would be C#. I find the numbers are better for 2 reasons </p><p>
Firstly if you use the note letter system you have to specify octave 
changes (c3 is middle C, c4 the octave above and c2 the octave below</p><p>
Secondly if you use the number system you can change the pitch of a
tune by adding or subtracting the same whole number from each note in the
tune.</p><p>
</p><p>
The length of each note is specified by the letter following the note as
shown below</p><p>

</p><h3>Using SoundChannel</h3>
In the latest version of HyperCard the <b>soundChannel</b> property 
reflects the channel through which sound is played. By immediately 
switching channels and playing new sounds, several sounds can be played 
nearly simultaneously as in this example<p>

</p><form>
<textarea rows="20" cols="40" wrap="off">on mouseUp
  put the soundChannel into chan
  play harpsichord c e g
  wait 2 seconds
  set the soundChannel to 1
  play harpsichord c2
  set the soundChannel to 2
  play harpsichord e3
  set the soundChannel to 3
  play harpsichord g
  set the soundChannel to 4
  play harpsichord e2
  set the soundChannel to 5
  play harpsichord g4
  set the soundChannel to 6
  play harpsichord c5
  set the soundChannel to chan
end mouseUp

</p><h3>Script for a Button to play Random Music</h3>
Copy this script and paste it into a button in your stack. When you 
click on it it will play random music till you click again! It plays a 
pentatonic music (only the black notes). If you have a different sound 
resource in your stack just replace the word harpsichord in the script 
with the name of the new sound<p>

</p><form>
<textarea rows="15" cols="70" wrap="off">on mouseUp
  put "harpsichord" into instrument
  put "51 54 56 58 61 63 66 68 70 73 75 56 58 61 63 66 68 51 54 56" into notes
  put "s e e e e e3 e e e e e e3 e s s s s s s t q h. w" into duration
  put number of words in notes into num
  put number of words in duration into dur
  set hilite of me to true
  repeat until the mouseClick
    play instrument word random(num) of notes &amp; word random(dur) of duration
    wait until the sound is done
  end repeat
  set hilite of me to false
end mouseUp
