</p><h2>Resource Mover</h2>

In HyperCard's Power Tools Stack you will find many useful tools. Perhaps the most useful is <b>The Resource Mover.</b><p>
 
Many of the things that you find in a HyperCard stack are resources. 
Icons, cursors, pictures, sounds, palettes, external functions and 
external commands are all examples of resources. The Resource Mover 
allows you to copy resources between stacks, delete resources from 
stacks, and change resource names and ID numbers. It also allows
you to play "snd" resources and to view ICON, CURS, and PICT resources.</p><p>
