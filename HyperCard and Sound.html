<h2>HyperCard and Sound</h2>
<h2>Audio Palette</h2>
For many years Macs have had built in sound recording so you easily 
record and edit the sound you want to use in your stacks. The latest 
versions of hyperCard
have a built in sound recorder and editor called the Audio Palette. Make
 sure
that you have a the Audio Help stack among your hyperCard stacks. If 
this stack
is present you will find Audio and Audio Help as menu items under the 
Edit menu
of the menubar. <p>

you save a recorded sound using the Save button a button is made on your card</p><p>

If you take a look at the script of this button you will find a very long and
involved script. For playing the sound you have recorded you could reduce the
script to 3 lines </p><p>
</p><form>
<textarea rows="5" cols="40" wrap="off">on mouseUp
   play "guitar"
end mouseUp
</textarea>
</form><p>

If you had or made a sound resource called "how are you going" the button
script would then be</p><p>
</p><form>
<textarea rows="5" cols="40" wrap="off">on mouseUp
   play "how are you going"
end mouseUp
</textarea>
</form><p>


Using the play command you can play any digital sounds stored in the stack as a resource. Like all resources the sound
resources can be moved from one stack to another using Power Tools.</p><p>

<img src="HyperCard%20and%20Sound_files/sound11.gif"><p>
HyperCard can read out text in a field if you have installed PlainTalk. You
will also need to have the exstensions Speech Manager and MacinTalk Pro, and a
folder for Voices in the system folder.</p><p>

Your Mac must have a 68020 chip or greater so you can not use speech on a Mac
Plus or Classic.</p><p>
